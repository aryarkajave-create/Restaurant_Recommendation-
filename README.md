**Essenza Dining** is an intelligent, web-based recommendation engine designed to curate personalized dining experiences in Bangalore. Moving beyond generic "top-10" lists, this project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze unstructured customer reviews and quantitative metrics (cuisine, cost, ratings).

By processing these features through a custom TF-IDF vectorization engine, Essenza Dining provides highly accurate, taste-matched restaurant recommendations instantly.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Install all required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the Model (Jupyter Notebook)
> **Note:** Before booting the web server, you must clean the raw dataset and generate the trained machine learning matrix.

1.  Navigate to the `Flask/` directory and ensure your extracted `zomato.csv` file is present.
2.  Open `Restaurant_Recommendation_System.ipynb` using Jupyter or VS Code.
3.  Execute all cells sequentially to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and train the model.
4.  Verify that `restaurant.pkl` and `restaurant1.csv` have been generated in your folder.

### 3. Run the Application
Start the local server by executing the main Flask application:
```bash
python app1.py
```

### 4. Access the Interface
Open your web browser and navigate to:
`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

## 🧠 Architectural Workflow

1.  **Dynamic Input:** As the user types, an AJAX request queries the backend to suggest matching restaurant names, ensuring accurate data entry.
2.  **Vectorization & Inference:** Upon submission, the application loads the `restaurant.pkl` file, containing a pre-computed matrix of **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) scores.
3.  **Similarity Scoring:** The system identifies the target restaurant's index and calculates the top 10 matches based on **Cosine Similarity** scores.
4.  **Data Presentation:** The Pandas DataFrame is formatted into a clean, Tailwind-styled HTML dashboard for the user.
